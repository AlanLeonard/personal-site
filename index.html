				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>At work, I find myself in my element when I'm straddling the line between designer and developer. My education has provided a solid design foundation which enables me to make appropriate decisions without needing to engage a designer. Speaking both design and technology languages, I've served as a good go-between for Design and Technology, translating design requirements into something that may be better understood by a developer.</p>
				<p>Ultimately, I'm happiest working in code. I find joy in making things work, and optimizing <em>how</em> they work to maximize their effectivness. If building a prototype, I'm going fast, but laying a strong foundation for production code at the same time.</p>
				<p>At play, I have a passion for the outdoors. Hiking, mountain biking, canoeing, fishing, trail running are all ways that I find my way outside. I have two young boys that I enjoy taking on adventures with me, and a loving wife who thankfully loves these adventures as well. I've converted my backyard to a micro-farm, with chickens and a handful of vegetable gardens. My goal is to make a noticable impact on our grocery bill. I haven't had to buy garlic at the grocery store for the last three years, which is a badge of honor for me.</p>
